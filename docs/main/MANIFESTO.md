> _**[@KHTHONDEV:](https://github.com/khthondev)** Kudos to Tom Kuntz for the **[EDUPUNK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edupunk)** term (being an edupunk myself for years helped me understand the world around me better) and inspiration for the **EDUPUNK OS MOVEMENT.** Tom described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom"_

# PROBLEM

### CORPORATE EDTECH HAS MUTATED FROM A TEACHING AID INTO A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PARASITE

<img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaG8wbWFwZTM2Z3AyN2hnOWpycG5zN3VkYXAzeG1oeGJ6dnZpNXkzaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/QXPB1mCBDTpW4hMjeK/giphy.gif" width="350" alt="Wedding Cake">

> _**[@KHTHONDEV:](https://github.com/khthondev)** I was blown away by the things I discovered while laying the foundation for this project. I think humanity can do much better if we really want to reach for the stars. I decided to keep the numbers out of the Manifesto and just invite awesome data folks to join **[RESEARCH SQUAD](../research/RESEARCH.md)** and help me pinpoint exact problems causing this shit and build tools really needed by the community_

## SCARY THINGS SCARING KIDS

### BLOATWARE THAT KILLS LEARNING

- You need multiple training sessions just to grade homework
- Most features exist to impress admin demos, not help teachers
- Simple tasks require navigating through endless menus
- Updates constantly break working workflows

### PRIVACY NIGHTMARE

- Student data gets harvested and sold as "learning analytics"
- AI systems discriminate against minority students
- Every click, submission, and interaction gets logged and analyzed
- Third-party trackers lurk in every corner

### FINANCIAL DRAIN

- Schools waste budgets on features teachers never use
- Districts get locked into expensive multi-year contracts
- "Free" tools secretly harvest student data for profit
- Teachers buy basic features with their own money

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### TEACHER AUTONOMY

- **Design for reality**, not admin demos
- **Simple tools** that just work
- **Deploy in minutes**, not months
- **Control your classroom**, not the other way around
- **Bend it, shape it** — everything is customizable

### STUDENT PRIVACY

- **No tracking**, period. _(it's like sniffing underwear — obnoxious)_
- **Your data, your servers** - not in corpo clouds
- **Self-hosted AI** that respects boundaries
- **No surveillance** disguised as "engagement metrics"
- **Learn without being watched** — radical concept, huh?

### COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP

- **AGPLv3 licensed** — forever free, forever open
- **Users set the roadmap**, not investors
- **Transparent decisions** — no backroom deals
- **Documentation first** — accessibility is rebellion
- **Purpose over profit** — solving real classroom problems

> _**[@KHTHONDEV:](https://github.com/khthondev)** My first step as the founding design engineer is to create the Edupunk OS MVP. This involves designing and coding the core feature set. I'll need some time to assess where I'll require assistance from the scene_

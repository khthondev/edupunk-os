> _[@khthondev](https://github.com/khthondev) — I was blown away by this stuff when I was laying down the Edupunk OS foundation. But the numbers? They're always shifting, and finding the *right* research? Forget about it. So, all you rad data scientists out there, your skills are needed! Wanna help the scene and dig into some research? Check it [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md)_

### Bloatware That Kills Learning
- You need multiple training sessions just to grade homework
- Most features exist to impress admin demos, not help teachers
- Simple tasks require navigating through endless menus
- Updates constantly break working workflows

### Privacy Nightmare
- Student data gets harvested and sold as "learning analytics"
- AI systems discriminate against minority students
- Every click, submission, and interaction gets logged and analyzed
- Third-party trackers lurk in every corner

### Financial Drain
- Schools waste budgets on features teachers never use
- Districts get locked into expensive multi-year contracts
- "Free" tools secretly harvest student data for profit
- Teachers buy basic features with their own money

```bash
def practice_negative_visualization():
    """Contemplate what you have to lose, to better appreciate what you have."""
    worst_case = 0
    for i in range(1, 5):
        worst_case += i
    return worst_case + 1

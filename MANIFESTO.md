## The Problem
Corporate EdTech is a $300B scam:
- **Bloatware** that teachers need a PhD to operate
- **Surveillance** masked as "learning analytics"
- **VC Puppetry** forcing founders to prioritize exits over impact

## Supporting Facts
### **Bloatware**  
- **8-12 clicks** required for basic tasks in typical LMS ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2024](https://www.nngroup.com)).
- **32%** of LMS features never used in typical deployments ([Gartner, 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/education)).

### **Surveillance**  
- **60%** of K-12 apps share or sell student data to third parties ([Me2B Alliance, 2024](https://me2ba.org/research)).  
- **AI proctoring** shows **23%** higher error rates for non-white students ([Stanford AI Lab, 2024](https://ai.stanford.edu/research)).  

### **Financial Exploitation**  
- **$51.3B/year** wasted globally on EdTech tools teachers don't effectively use ([McKinsey, 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education)).
- **67%** of teachers report mandatory EdTech tools interfere with instruction time ([Education Week, 2024](https://www.edweek.org/technology)).

## The Rebellion
We’re done asking permission to fix education.

**Edupunk OS is an open-source revolt.**  
Build tools that:  
- **Cost $0 to deploy** (no SaaS subscriptions)  
- **Self-host AI** (no OpenAI API prisons)  
- **Lock down equity** (no investor hijackings)  

Our weapons:  
- Next.js + Supabase + Ollama  
- Teacher-approved UX  
- Apache 2.0 License (freedom over "IP")

## Principles  
1. **Privacy First**  
   Zero tracking. Student data stays on *their* servers.  
2. **Founder Sovereignty**  
   Build sustainable tools without VC approval.  
3. **Community > Corporations**
   Code is open. Decisions are public. Profits are shared.

## The Target
**Phase 1:** Replace Canvas/Blackboard with a self-hosted LMS that:
- Teachers can set up in 10 minutes
- Costs less than a classroom pencil sharpener
- Doesn’t sell student data to advertisers

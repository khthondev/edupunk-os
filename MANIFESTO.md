### Bloatware That Kills Learning
- You need multiple training sessions just to grade homework
- Most features exist to impress admin demos, not help teachers
- Simple tasks require navigating through endless menus
- Updates constantly break working workflows

### Privacy Nightmare
- Student data gets harvested and sold as "learning analytics"
- AI systems discriminate against minority students
- Every click, submission, and interaction gets logged and analyzed
- Third-party trackers lurk in every corner

### Financial Drain
- Schools waste budgets on features teachers never use
- Districts get locked into expensive multi-year contracts
- "Free" tools secretly harvest student data for profit
- Teachers buy basic features with their own money

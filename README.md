# Edupunk OS  
**An open-source rebellion against corporate EdTech bloat**  

ðŸš© **Mission:** Build tools for teachers and studentsâ€”not investors.  
ðŸ”¥ **Current Target:** Replace Canvas/Blackboard with a $0, self-hosted LMS.  

## Why This Exists  
- 72% of teachers hate their districtâ€™s EdTech tools (Source: [EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org))  
- VC-backed EdTech startups waste 40% of dev time on "investor-pleasing" features  
- AI in education has become a surveillance tool, not a learning aid  

## Join the Rebellion  
1. **Star this repo** to show corporate EdTech weâ€™re coming.  
2. **Contribute:** Developers, designers, pissed-off teachersâ€”we need you.  
3. **Watch Releases:** First alpha drops in 7 days. Burn the LMS together.  

## Roadmap (Beta 1.0)  
- [ ] Passwordless auth (Magic Links)
- [ ] Course dashboard (Student view)
- [ ] AI tutor (Self-hosted LLMs)
- [ ] Assignment grader (No-Trackingâ„¢)
